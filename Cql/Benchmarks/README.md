## Creating the Benchmarks project

The Benchmarks project was created by installing the BenchmarkDotNet.Templates package. The package provides a template for creating a new Benchmark project. 
The template is installed by running the following command:

```cmd
dotnet new install BenchmarkDotNet.Templates
```

After the template is installed, a new Benchmark project can be created.

(This README file was not included in the template.)
